### 🔧 **Components Created**

#### **DesignerPage** - Main Layout
- Manages overall page structure
- Coordinates file operations
- Handles navbar and layout positioning

#### **DesignerCanvas** - ReactFlow Canvas
- ReactFlow setup and configuration
- Node and edge rendering
- Canvas interaction handling

#### **DesignerModals** - Modal Management
- Centralizes all modal rendering
- Handles modal state coordination
- Clean separation of modal logic

### 🎣 **Custom Hooks Created**

#### **useModalState** - State Management
- Manages all modal states
- Provides open/close actions
- Type-safe state updates

#### **useDesignerActions** - Business Logic
- Collection CRUD operations
- Field CRUD operations
- Context menu handling
- Toast notifications

#### **useReactFlowHandler** - ReactFlow Logic
- Node/edge data transformation
- ReactFlow event handling
- Connection management

#### **useFileOperations** - File Handling
- Schema import/export
- File validation
- Canvas clearing operations

### 🛠️ **Issues Resolved**

#### ✅ **Canvas Visibility Issue**
- **Problem**: Canvas not visible after refactoring
- **Root Cause**: Layout height inheritance and node type registration
- **Solution**: Fixed container positioning and node type mapping
- **Result**: Canvas now fully functional

#### ✅ **Topbar Visibility Issue**
- **Problem**: Navbar covered by canvas
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect viewport height calculation
- **Solution**: Proper navbar height accounting (`calc(100vh - 64px)`)
- **Result**: Both canvas and navbar now visible

#### ✅ **Build Success**
- **Status**: Project builds without errors
- **TypeScript**: All type errors resolved
- **Functionality**: All original features preserved

### 🚀 **Current Status**

✅ **Refactoring**: Complete  
✅ **Canvas**: Visible and functional  
✅ **Topbar**: Visible and accessible  
✅ **Build**: Successful  
✅ **TypeScript**: No errors  
✅ **Functionality**: All features working  

### 🎨 **What You Now Have**

1. **Clean Architecture**: Well-organized, maintainable code structure
2. **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage
3. **Reusable Components**: Modular, focused components
4. **Custom Hooks**: Reusable business logic
5. **Better Performance**: Optimized rendering and state management
6. **Enhanced DX**: Better debugging and development experience

### 🔄 **Migration Complete**

The refactoring is now complete! The designer folder has been transformed from a difficult-to-maintain monolith into a clean, well-structured architecture that follows React best practices and provides excellent developer experience.
